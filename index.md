## About Me

Hi, I'm Nand Chandravadia! I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science (*Machine Learning Track*) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in NYC. Before that, I was a research associate at Caltech/Cedars-Sinai, studying computational and theoretical neuroscience. Before that, I studied neuroscience at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), where I worked on brain-computer interfaces.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in utilizing the "algorithmic lens" (as referred by theoretical computer scientists) 
to study the brain (among other topics). More specifically, I am interested in theoretical machine learning, theoretical neuroscience, and 
computational/applied math.  

Outside of academia, I enjoy trail running, puzzles, chess, poker, and tennis! I am also an aspiring [Effective Altruist](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/).
