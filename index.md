## About Me

Hi, I'm Nand Chandravadia! I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science (*Machine Learning Track*) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in NYC. 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in utilizing the "algorithmic lens" (as referred by theoretical computer scientists) 
to study the brain (among other topics). More specifically, I am interested in theoretical machine learning, theoretical neuroscience, and 
computational/applied math.  

Outside of academia, I enjoy trail running, puzzles, chess, poker, and tennis! 

You can find more information about me here: [nandc.us](http://nandc.us/). 

## About My Advisor

[Dr. Nabil Imam](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/nabil-imam/) is an Assistant Professor in the College of Computing
@ [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/). He works on topics in machine learning and 
theoretical neuroscience with the goal of understanding general principles of neural coding and computation, and 
their technological applications.

## About My Project

How can we endow artificial neural networks with the capacity for life-long (i.e., continual) learning? Recently, algorithmic insights into the olfactory (neural) circuit of the *Drosophila Melanogaster* have been discovered that endows it with the ability to acquire novel information, while preserving old memories. In this work, we leverage these algorithmic insights, notably sparse coding via a random projection, a *k*-winner-take-all computation, (partial) synaptic freezing, and associative learning, to build an artificial system with the ability of continual learning.
